# Check-in API

![Vipps](./images/vipps.png) *Only available for Vipps.*

![MobilePay](../images/mp.png) *To be determined.*

The Check-in API allows you to communicate with users through their Vipps app from the Point of Sale (POS).
For example, a user can scan their personal Vipps QR code and be informed if they are a member of a company's loyalty program.

The Check-in API is still in development and is available to use for merchants that work with loyalty, as shown in
[In-store payments with customer club](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/solutions/loyalty-in-pos).
Future changes to the visuals and the text shown on the check-in screen is expected to change over time.
