# Vipps Check-in API

üí• DRAFT! Unfinished work in progress. API specification changes are still coming. üí•


<!-- START_COMMENT -->

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please use the new documentation:
[Vipps Technical Documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/check-in-api).

<!-- END_COMMENT -->

The Check-in API allows you to communicate with users through their Vipps app from the Point of Sale (POS).
For example, a user can scan their personal Vipps QR code and be informed if they are a member of a company's loyalty program.

The Check-in API is in beta and is available to use for merchants that work with [Loyalty in POS](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-solutions/loyalty-in-pos).
